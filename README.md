## Architecture Overview

This project adopts a Layered Architecture that ensures clean separation of responsibilities and promotes
maintainability, testability, and scalability.

**Controller Layer**
- Exposes RESTful API endpoints.

- Handles HTTP requests and responses.

- Delegates business logic to the service layer.

**Service Layer**

- Contains core business logic.

- Coordinates between controllers, repositories, and external services (e.g., payment, notifications).

- Ensures validation and business rule enforcement.

**Repository Layer**

- Manages data persistence and access using Spring Data JPA.

- Interaction with the MySQL database.

- Use custom queries when needed for complex data access logic.

**Model Layer**

- Defines domain entities representing database tables.

- Includes DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to encapsulate and transport data between layers in a secure and 
efficient manner.

**Mapper Layer**

- Use MapStruct to automatically convert between entities and DTOs.

- Helps keep the service and controller layers clean.

**Security Layer**

- Implements JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.

- Manage login, token issuance, and authorization rules via Spring Security.

**Notification Layer**

- Sends real-time Telegram notifications for key events (e.g., rental car, payment status).

**Payment Integration**

- Integrates with Stripe for secure, reliable online payments.

###  Fork and Clone a Project on GitHub

Forking creates a personal copy of someone else's repository under your GitHub account.

- [Go to the GitHub page of the repository you want to fork](https://github.com/StarAntonU/car-sharing)
- Click the "Fork" button in the upper-right corner
- Select your GitHub account (or organization) to create the fork

  You now have your own copy of the project.

Make sure you have Git installed on your machine

- You can check by running:
```
git --version
```

Cloning downloads your forked project to your local machine so you can run or work on it.

- On your forked repository page (on your GitHub account), click the "Code" button
- Copy the URL under HTTPS or SSH
- Open a terminal (or Git Bash) on your computer
- Run the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/StarAntonU/car-sharing.git
```

### How to Launch a Spring Boot Application with Maven or Docker Compose

Before running the application, ensure the following tools are installed and available:
- Java (17 or compatible)
```
java -version
```
- Maven (3.8+ recommended)
```
mvn -version
```
- Docker & Docker Compose
```
docker --version
docker compose version
```
Open the Terminal
- Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer

Navigate to the Project Folder
- Use the cd command to move into the folder that contains your Spring Boot project (the folder with the pom.xml file):
```
cd path/to/your/project
```
*Example:*
```
cd ~/Documents/carsharing
```

Before running the project, create .env a file in the root directory with the required credentials

*Example:*
```
MYSQLDB_USER=your_data
MYSQLDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_data
MYSQLDB_DATABASE=your_data
MYSQLDB_LOCAL_PORT=your_data
MYSQLDB_DOCKER_PORT=your_data
SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=your_data
SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=your_data
DEBUG_PORT=your_data
JWT_EXPIRATION=your_data
JWT_SECRET=your_data
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_data
PAYMENT_SUCCESS_URL=your_data
PAYMENT_CANCEL_URL=your_data
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_data
```

Run the Application Using Maven
- Use the following command to launch the Spring Boot application:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Verify the Application is Running
- If successful, you will see logs ending with something like:
```
Started CarsharingApplication in X.XXX seconds (process running for X.XXX)
```

**Or Use Docker Compose to run app**

- Run the app with Docker Compose
```
docker compose up --build
```

Now that Spring Boot application is running, you can use Postman (or any other REST client) to test its API endpoints.
